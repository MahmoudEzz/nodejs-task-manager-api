This is a task manager API app -> you can create user (login / logout),
add task for this user. Every user can access only his tasks and do simple CRUD on it.
user also can upload a profile picture.

In this little project I've used express for starting my server and dealing with :

# REST API
# MongoDB  -> Mongoose
# Auth
# Middlewares
# JWT
# Multer -> uploading files
# sharp -> manipulate images
# SendGrid -> sending emails
# Atlas -> mongodb for production

I've deployed this simple project on Heroku which you can have a look on it by this link: https://ezz-task-manager.herokuapp.com/
and test the project using the provided postman collection I've used in the Repo.
